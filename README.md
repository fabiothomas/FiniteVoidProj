 Unity version: 2021.3.13f1<br />
<br />
 To change a planet's orbit select the planet (make sure to select the planet object not just the mesh object) and you can play around with the values of the OrbitObject script. A custom editor makes it very easy to use.<br />
     -  There are 3 presets: <br />
            Circular creates a simple circle orbit with a desired speed<br />
            Elliptic creates an elliptic orbit with desired width, speed, and an offset (distance between object to orbit around and center of ellipse)<br />
            Custom creates a custom orbit by accepting any vectors with their speeds as input which it adds together similar to a Fourier Transform.<br />
 Some debug/visebility options are available in a script under the 'Universe' object<br />
