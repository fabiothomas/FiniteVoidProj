 This is a concept.

 To change a planet's orbit select the planet (make sure to select the planet object not just the mesh object) and you can play around with the values of the OrbitObject script. A custom editor makes it very easy to use.
     -  There are 3 presets:
            Circular creates a simple circle orbit with a desired speed.
            Elliptic creates an elliptic orbit with desired width, speed, and an offset (distance between object to orbit around and center of ellipse).
            Custom creates a custom orbit by accepting any vectors with their speeds as input which it adds together similar to a Fourier Transform.
 Some debug/visebility options are available in a script under the 'Universe' object.
